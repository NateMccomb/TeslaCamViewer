Install
======================================
I have included a precompiled version in the Binary folder for easy install.

If you have the Tesla FSD Computer(HW3) installed and/or get black videos, then you'll need to install the H.265 codec. 

* [Microsoft H.265 codec (HEVC Video Extensions)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer/9n4wgh0z6vhq?irgwc=1&OCID=AID681541_aff_7593_159229&tduid=%28ir_wJC0gNTClQca0BAzqwxkEXPhUkjTGXQhW1412Y0%29%287593%29%28159229%29%28%29%28UUwpUdUnU56397YYwYd%29&irclickid=wJC0gNTClQca0BAzqwxkEXPhUkjTGXQhW1412Y0&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)
